# lstatdemo

NOTE: This package will not be updated. Will move back to [statdemos](https://github.com/sfcheung/statdemos). Instead of using a package, it is better to create a zip archive for each app such that users can download the desired demo and run it using `shiny::runUrl`.

Demonstrations, usually shiny apps, for learning statistics.

Still in very early development. Apps in `statDemos` have been migrated to this repository. However, they have not yet been fully adapted.
